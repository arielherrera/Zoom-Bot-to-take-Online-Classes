# Zoom Meeting Bot
### This is meant for educational purposes only and merely an experiment to familiarize myself with python and its web controlling capabilites from the selenium package.
This is a python zoom bot which automates the process of joining a zoom meeting. Script is meant to run at a certain time (zoom meeting start time). Extensibility will be added to exit based on change in class size, time, etc.
